Have that one song you love and want to find more tracks just like it? This app does just that! It utilizes a song's attributes
such as its lyrics, tempo, liveness, energy, etc..., and provides more accurate recommendations of the inputted song! You're also
able to track what you're top artists/songs are in the last month, six months, and all time.

This was inspired after I was trying to find more songs similar to "love." by wave to earth. But Spotify radio kept giving me tracks
that I already knew or just weren't related at all. This app allowed me to find tracks that actually sounded just like it and weren't
just some random track recommendation based on my overall listening activity, like Spotify does.

This fullstack app was built with React on the frontend, and an Express.js server powered by Node.js on the backend. It utilizes a proper
OAuth flow with both implicit grants and/or token based logins to access user data and play tracks on the webpage.
